libschrift-show
===============

This is a program to test the features of [libschrift](https://github.com/tomolt/libschrift), a lightweight TrueType font rendering library. Unlike the demos in libschrift, show.c does not depend on any graphics environment: it generates a PGM file, which can be viewed virtually everywhere.

The code in show.c is hereby placed in the public domain and also under the MIT license.

See the LICENSE file for copyright and license details on the code in schrift.c and schrift.h.
